This repository contains implementations of various high-level data structures and algorithms written in Java. These data structures include abstract classes for iterable maps and double-ended queues, as well as specific implementations such as priority queues, hash maps, and trees.

The abstract classes provide a common interface for implementing different versions of the data structures, making it easier to switch between them or use them in combination with other code.

The implementation files use efficient algorithms to perform operations such as search, insertion, and deletion on key-value pairs, as well as provide ways to handle collisions and manage data in different ways.
